~Android Control APP~

To connect the LARIX Quadcopter with the Android Smartphone simply click on the quadcopter animation.
Another click will disconnect the connection to the quadcopter.
There is already a Button for Altitude Control implemented for future Altitude Hold functions in the flightcontroller.

Changelog:

In your bluetooth settings, only one "XMC-Bluetooth" device is allowed. If there are multiple ones, remove all of them.
Once you removed all you finally can pair with the "XMC-Bluetooth". In some cases you need 2-3 attempts to pair the quadcopter.
In general every bluetooth module has it's own MAC-adress. It is important that you only have one bluetooth Module with the name "XMC-Bluetooth" in your list of paired devices.
